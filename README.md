# nCoviTracker
Tracking system for separated Covid-19 patients using BeagleBone Black.

This project is our final project of Embedded Project course. In this project, we chose to do a project using BeagleBoneBlack, which is a Linux embedded computer.
There are 3 main components of this project:
1. Web server
2. Data collecting(using HDC1080, CCS811, GY-906)
3. A Windows app which can display the sensor's data and control some GPIO pins(turn on/off fan/led for example)
